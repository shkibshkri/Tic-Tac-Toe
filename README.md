# Tic-Tac-Toe (limited mark version)

## Description
The present game is a little bit different from the traditional tic-tac-toe. In this game you just have three marks. Instead of putting the fourth mark, you have to change one of your three previous marks in the table.
In that case, the game never ends in a draw!
